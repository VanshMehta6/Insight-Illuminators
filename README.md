# Insight-Illuminators
X-ray vision for student thinking. We don't just grade answers; we map the exact step where reasoning secretly breaks and give teachers the language to fix it. See invisible thought fractures in 30 seconds.

🌟 The Problem
Current EdTech grades answers, not thinking. Teachers see wrong answers but can't pinpoint where reasoning fractures—creating a "cognitive black box" where 68% of learning gaps remain invisible.

✨ Our Solution
Insight Illuminators exposes hidden thought fractures in student reasoning:
🧠 Thought-Gap Detector: Traces each mental step, highlights where logic jumps
🔬 Micro-Diagnostic: Generates one surgical question that reveals true understanding
🎯 Misconception Radar: Names errors like "unit blindness" or "velocity-acceleration confusion"
🧭 Next-Best Action: Recommends exact next move, not a menu of options

🚀 Live Features
Interactive Demo: Try our live fracture scanner with real student reasoning examples
Teacher Dashboard: Class heatmaps, top misconceptions, progress analytics
Multi-Page Site: Complete product tour, pricing, use cases, teacher personas
Judge-Ready: 2-minute competition demo script with exact talking points

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), JavaScript (ES6+)
Animations: GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Particles.js
Design: Professional blue theme with modern glass effects
Google Integration: Fonts, Classroom API, OAuth, Vision AI, Gemini API
Responsive: Mobile-first, fully adaptive design\
